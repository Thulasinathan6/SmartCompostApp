# ♻️ Smart Compost Prediction App

This is a simple yet impactful AI-powered web application that predicts whether an organic waste item is **compostable** or **non-compostable**. The purpose of this project is to raise environmental awareness, reduce landfill waste, and guide people toward effective organic waste management using machine learning.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Instant Prediction** of compostability using a trained ML model
- 🧠 **Naive Bayes Classifier** trained on labeled organic waste items
- 🌱 Promotes eco-friendly waste disposal
- 🖥️ Lightweight and easy to run on any machine
- 🧑‍💻 Minimal tech stack — perfect for learning Flask and ML deployment

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

The ML model is a **Naive Bayes classifier** trained on a small dataset of waste items. Each item is labeled as either:

- **Compostable** (e.g., banana peel, eggshell, vegetable waste)
- **Non-Compostable** (e.g., plastic, glass, battery)

The model uses simple text-based input and tokenization to classify new inputs. In future versions, you can improve accuracy by:

- Expanding the dataset
- Using NLP models like TF-IDF or Word2Vec
- Implementing Logistic Regression or Random Forest

## 🌍 Real-World Impact

This project was inspired by the idea of sustainable living and smart waste management. Aimed at communities, students, and eco-conscious individuals, this app offers:

- Awareness about waste segregation
- Contribution to reducing landfill waste
- A stepping stone for deploying real-world ML in sustainability

---

## 🧪 Future Improvements

- Add image-based compost prediction using deep learning (CNNs)
- Build a mobile app version (React Native or Flutter)
- Integrate composting tips and guidance
- Connect with IoT sensors for live compost monitoring
